## 👴🏻 Words of wisdom 

### 📝 Always use numbered list instead of bulleted lists

> **Why?** It is easier to discuss each topic points by referencing numbers instead of repeating whole point.

### 🔮 What?, Why?, When?, Who?, Where?, How?

> When you are doing anything always answer these questions in this specific order.  
> **Why?**  
> 1. `What` we are doing, is project fully defined?  
> 2. `Why` we are doing this, is it really necessary?  
> 3. `When` this needs to be finished?  
> 4. `Who` will be working on this project? He/She should be part of the planning.  
> 5. `Where` we will implement it? Cloud? On-prem? Shed? Attic?  
> 6. `How` to successfuly build our project based on all previous questions.
